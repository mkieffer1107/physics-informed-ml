Well, in the [boundary value notebook](boundary.ipynb), we found that we could solve for PDEs with functions of the form $f(x, y)$ (two independent variables) by laying out a grid of discrete points, defining the values on the boundaries, and relaxing the system toward a solution. So we might imagine that we could do the same with time. For the 1D example above, we would have a line of spaced out $x$ values that we could drag downward in time $t$ to create a similar grid of points $\\{(x, t)\\}$. This, however, will not work because we do not know all of the boundary conditions for the system. We would know the boundary conditions at the top of the grid at $t = 0$ -- these are our initial conditions -- but we would not know the boundary conditions at the bottom of the grid, as they occur at a point in time that we have not observed yet! The whole point of initial value problems is to find out how our solution evolves with time! So we need to try something else."
